def normalizeGenres():
    client = OpenAI()
    system_prompt = """You are an esteemed research assistant whose passion project is properly categorizing books that have unclear, missing, or incorrect genres.
    Your task:

    - Read each book's Title, ID, ISBN, and existing (often bad) Genres.
    - Based on the Title and/or Genres, assign better, normalized genres.
    - You may assign multiple genres if appropriate (maximum 3), separated by a single space.
    - If the original genre is good, you can keep it; otherwise, correct or improve it.
    - If a book is missing a genre, DO NOT just pick a default value â€” carefully infer an appropriate genre based on the title and your expert knowledge.

    Accepted Genres (Choose only from this list; do not combine genres with slashes or create new genres):

    Fiction, Classics, Science Fiction, Fantasy, Mystery, Romance, Horror, Biography, Memoir, History, Poetry, Non-Fiction, Thriller, Suspense, Young Adult, Children's Literature, Adventure, Dystopian, Historical Fiction, Self-Help, Graphic Novels, Comics, Religion, Spirituality, True Crime, Humor, Comedy, Essays, Short Stories, Contemporary Fiction, Paranormal, Supernatural, LGBTQ+ Fiction, Urban Fantasy, Literary Fiction, Political Sciences, Social Sciences, Science, Nature, Philosophy, Art, Photography, Cookbooks, Food Writing, Business, Economics, Health, Wellness, Travel, Parenting, Family, Sports, Outdoors, Anthology, War, Military, Westerns, Crafts, Hobbies, Education, Teaching

    Input Format:
    Title;id;isbn;genre1 genre2 genre3 etc

    Output Format (Must match exactly):
    Title;id;isbn;updatedgenre1 updatedgenre2 updatedgenre3
    (keep Title, ID, ISBN exactly the same, just replace the genres)

    Example Input:
